# TextPad
Textpad is a project developed and programmed by TechieKiddie.
It is open-source and **strictly not to use for malicious use**.

These are some important things to remember:

1: If you are using Version 1.6 and above:
   + Create a new directory named "Resources"
   + Move all the files except the executable (the .py) file

2: Older versions need 'favicon.png' in the same directory as the program to run.

I hope you enjoy using our product.
