# TextPad
Textpad is a project developed and coded by TechieKiddie.
It is open-source and strictly not to use for malicious use.

These are some important things to remember:
1: Version 1.6 and above have different Resource folder and it is necessary for the program to work.
2: Don't delete 'test.txt'. It is for testing purposes.
3: Installer has some bugs which have to ix.
4: Older versions need 'favicon.png' in the same folder as the program to run.

I hope you enjoy using our product.
